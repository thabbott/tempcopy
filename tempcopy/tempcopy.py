class TempCopy:

    An object that represents a temporary copy of a file. This class is fairly
    flexible, but is intended for working with files stored in a high-volume 
    but high-latency archive that must be copied to a temporary scratch
    directory before use.
    
    The user is responsible for specifying the source file; the destination is 
    determined automatically by appending the absolute path of the source file 
    to `xcrm.config['tempcopy_dir']`. Optional arguments control the method
    used to copy the file, whether copying occurs synchronously or 
    asynchronously, whether copying is started immediately or delayed,
    whether cached copies of the source file overwritten, and whether an
    (advisory) locking scheme is used to prevent multiple `TempCopy` instances
    from simultaneously trying to copy to the same destination file.
    
    Note that no attempt is made to clear up child processes (i.e., processes
    handling asynchronous copies) if their parent process (i.e., the process
    creating `TempCopy` instances) dies.

        """
        Create a new `TempCopy` object from a source file.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        source: str
            Absolute path to source file.
            
        copy_with: str or function, optional
            Method for copying files. Can be one of {'shutil', 'gcp'}. Future
            updates may add support for user-defined functions.
            
            * 'shutil': use `shutil.copy` and `shutil.copystat` to copy the 
              file and metadata. This is the only pre-defined method that avoids
              invoking an external program.
            * 'gcp': use the `gcp` program to copy the file. This is designed
              specifically for use on NOAA computer cluster and is likely to
              fail elsewhere.
              
        copy_async: bool, optional
            If True, run the copy operation asynchronously in a separate thread.
            Otherwise, run the copy operation in the current thread.
            
        copy_now: bool, optional
            If True, start the copy operation immediately. Otherwise, delay
            until `copy()` is called.
            
        overwrite: bool, optional
            If True, copy the source file even if it overwrites an existing file
            at the destination. Otherwise, only overwrite an existing file at
            the destination if the source file was modified more recently than
            the destination file.
            
        lock_on_copy: bool, optional
            If True, acquire a destination-specific lockfile before copying. The 
            locking scheme uses portalocker, which supports unix and windows 
            environments, but locking may need to be disabled on certain systems
            by setting `lock_on_copy=False`.
            
            Locks are used internally to prevent multiple `TempCopy` instances 
            from simultaneously copying to the same destination. However, they 
            do *not* prevent other processes from reading or writing to the
            destination file. This is true both on Unix, where file locks are
            advisory by default, and on Windows, where file locks are mandatory.
            The latter is because the locking scheme acquires and releases locks
            on a separate lockfile, not on the destination file (which may or
            may not exist when `copy` operations begin).
            
            When copying is asynchronous, locks are acquired and held by the
            *child* processes responsible for asynchronous copies.
            
        With default arguments `copy_async=False`, `copy_now=True`, and
        `overwrite=True`, creating a `TempCopy` immediately copies `source`, and
        the calling process blocks until the copy is complete. After completion,
        the `status` field of the created object is set to CopyStatus.FINISHED.
        
        With `copy_now=False`, the copy operation is delayed until the `copy`
        method of the `TempCopy` is invoked. The `status` field is initially set
        to `CopyStatus.DELAYED`.
        
        With `copy_async=False`, the copy operation is executed asynchronously
        in a separate process. (Whether it begins immediately or has to be
        manually triggered is still controlled by `copy_now`.) The `status`
        field is set to `CopyStatus.IN_PROGRESS` while the copy operation is
        executing. The `wait` method must be called before the destination file
        is used to ensure the copy operation finishes, and can be invoked
        directly or indirectly using the `path` method with 
        `not_finished='wait'`.
        
        Users are encouraged to use the `path` method rather than the `dest`
        attribute when accessing the copied file to avoid accessing a
        non-existent or incompletely-copied file.
